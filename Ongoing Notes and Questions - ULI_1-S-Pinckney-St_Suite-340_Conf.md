 - 16 to 20 person conference room
 - enclosure to be glass
	 - avoid 'fish bowl' affect however, with film/frosted banding or pattern
		 - 	 Transpaency: They like the idea of being able to look through the conference room, from the main corridor, and see the exterior windows.  
	 - most likely butt glazing, to match existing glass between space and main corridor

 - Light fixtures
	 - reuse existing recessed can lights
	 - nice pendant above conference table perhaps.
 - Ceiling
	 - Work with existing grid, if possible.. might not be possible, however.
 - Flooring
	 - reuse carpet... there's attic stock apparently.
 - Perhaps reuse reception desk stone top within custom conference table... perhaps as an inlay.
	 - This might/ might not work.
 - TV will most likely be relocated.
